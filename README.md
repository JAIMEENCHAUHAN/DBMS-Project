üìù Project Description
-----------------------
DBMS Mini Project: A Relational Database Management System  
This project is a mini-DBMS designed to simulate real-world database operations using SQL and back-end technologies. It showcases concepts such as ER modeling, normalization, data integrity, and transaction management. The system is developed to handle basic CRUD operations along with complex queries and business logic enforcement.

üîç Project Overview
-----------------------
This DBMS mini-project aims to provide a hands-on experience in designing and implementing a database application from scratch. The system follows a structured approach:

- Starts with an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, identifying key entities and relationships.
- Proceeds through normalization steps (up to 3NF) to ensure data consistency and minimal redundancy.
- Implements a relational schema using SQL (DDL & DML) to create and populate tables.
- Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data.
- Utilizes advanced SQL features such as:
  - Joins and subqueries
  - Views
  - Aggregate functions

This project serves as an end-to-end demonstration of core DBMS principles.
